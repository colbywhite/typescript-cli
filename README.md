# typescript-cli-template by [Colby M. White]

This is my preferred starting template for a vanilla typescript CLI project
with what I consider a sane set of starting settings.

It contains the following:
- Basic echo CLI based on [docopt]
- Basic interactive echo CLI based on [inquirer]
- Sane `tsconfig.json`
- Sane npm scripts
- Build packaging that results in a `typescript-cli-template` executable
  - Changing the name of the package will change the name of the executable
